    <mat-card-content>
      In Hearts, the goal is to get the lowest score possible by avoiding cards that are worth points.
      Once 100-point total has been reached by any player, the player with the lowest score wins.
      Hearts ♥ are worth 1 point each, and the Queen of Spades Q♠ is worth 13 points.

        Note that we have reduced 100 points to 20 points for more convenient testing.

    <mat-card-title><h3>Passing the Trash</h3></mat-card-title>
    <mat-card-content>
      3 cards must be passes to another player. The passing scheme is LEFT, RIGHT, ACROSS, and NO PASS. This cycle is
      repeated until the end of the game.
      The 2♣ of clubs plays first (lead) every hand.

    <mat-card-title><h3>Taking Tricks</h3></mat-card-title>
    <mat-card-content>
      Once a card is led, all remaining players must follow suit if they are able.
      The player with the highest-ranking card of the lead suit collects all 4 cards, also known as taking the TRICK.
      If you do not have any cards of the lead suit, you can play any other card, usually this is a good time to start
      dumping any heart ♥ you may have.
      The only exception to this rule is on the first TRICK, where you cannot play any Heart ♥ or the Queen of Spades
      Q♠.
      Whoever took the last trick leads the next one.

    <mat-card-title><h3>Breaking Hearts</h3></mat-card-title>
    <mat-card-content>
      You may lead with any card, but you cannot lead with a Heart ♥ until Hearts are broken. Hearts are broken after
      the first Heart ♥ is played.
