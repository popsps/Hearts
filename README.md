## Game Rules

### Objective

In Hearts, the goal is to get the lowest score possible by avoiding cards that are worth points.

Once 100 point total has been reached by any player, the player with the lowest score wins.

Hearts ♥ are worth 1 point each, and the Queen of Spades Q♠ is worth 13 points.

### Starting the Game

3 cards must be passes to another player. The passing scheme is LEFT Scheme. The 2♣ of clubs plays first (lead) every round.

### Gameplay

#### Taking Tricks

Once a card is led, all remaining players must follow suit if they are able.

The player with the highest-ranking card of the lead suit collects all 4 cards, also known as taking the TRICK.

If you do not have any cards of the lead suit, you can play any other card, Usually this is a good time to start dumping
any heart ♥ you may have.

The only exception to this rule is on the fist TRICK, where you cannot play any Heart ♥ or the Queen of Spades Q♠.

Whoever took the last trick leads the next one.

#### Breaking Hearts

You may lead with any card, but you cannot lead with a Heart ♥ until Hearts are broken. Hearts are broken after the
first Heart ♥ is played.
